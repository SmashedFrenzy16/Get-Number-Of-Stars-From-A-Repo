# Get Number Of Stars From A Repo
This is a Python program that gets the number of stars from a repo using the `PyGithub` (`pip install PyGithub`) module (which utilizes the GitHub REST API). Run `python3 repos-stars.py` in a terminal if you have Python 3.

NOTE: Replace `<Paste Your Token Here>` in `g_cred = Github("<Paste Your Token Here>")` (line 3 of repo-stars.py) with your personal access token.
